# Components, Skills & Presets

← [Back to README](../README.md)

---

## Components

| Component | ID | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Engram | `engram` | Persistent cross-session memory — managed automatically by the agent, no manual interaction needed |
| SDD | `sdd` | Spec-Driven Development workflow (9 phases) — the agent handles SDD organically when the task warrants it, or when you ask; you don't need to learn the commands |
| Skills | `skills` | Curated coding skill library |
| Context7 | `context7` | MCP server for live framework/library documentation |
| Persona | `persona` | Gentleman, neutral, or custom behavior mode |
| Permissions | `permissions` | Security-first defaults and guardrails |
| GGA | `gga` | Gentleman Guardian Angel — AI provider switcher |
| Theme | `theme` | Gentleman Kanagawa theme overlay |

## GGA Behavior

`gentle-ai --component gga` installs/provisions the `gga` binary globally on your machine.

It does **not** run project-level hook setup automatically (`gga init` / `gga install`) because that should be an explicit decision per repository.

After global install, enable GGA per project with:

```bash
gga init
gga install
```
